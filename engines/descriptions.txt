1. STOCKFISH
=========================
Authors: T. Romstad, M. Costalba, J. Kiiski, G. Linscott
Version: 7
Date: January 2016
Elo: 3100
Levels: yes
Chess960: yes
License: GPLv3
Source: https://stockfishchess.org/
Description: Stockfish is universally recognized as the strongest open source engine
in the world. Even on the modest hardware of a Raspberry Pi 3 it easily
beats every super grandmaster. The vast amount of chess knowledge
programmed into Stockfish makes it an ideal engine to analyze your
games. You can set the engine at a lower skill level to have a chance of
winning. Stockfish also supports Chess960 (‘Fischer Random Chess’).


2. TEXEL
=========================
Author: Peter Österlund
Version: 1.06
Date: July 2016
Elo: 2900
Levels: yes
Chess960: no
License: GPLv3
Source: http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/89684995/texel106.7z
Description: Texel is the successor to CuckooChess. It is a very strong engine that
will beat every human GM. But thanks to its different skill levels, Texel
will appeal to chess players of every strength. For absolute beginners
there is even a level 0, which lets the engine play random legal moves.


3. ARASAN
=========================
Author: Jon Dart
Version: 18.3
Date: March 2016
Elo: 2750
Levels: yes
Chess960: no
License: MIT
Source: http://arasanchess.org/
Description: Arasan, or ‘king’ in the Tamil language, is a chess engine that has been
around since 1994 – much longer than most other engines. It has evolved
a lot over the years and is now a very attractive GM level engine. Arasan
has a lot of features, including skill levels to make it an attractive opponent
for players of every strength.


4. RODENT II
=========================
Author: Paweł Kozioł
Version: 0.9.52
Date: July 2016
Elo: 2650
Levels: Personalities
Chess960: no
License: GPLv3
Source: https://github.com/nescitus/Rodent_II/
Description: RodentII is one of the few chess engines in the world that can adopt ‘personalities’: it offers different playing styles rather than strength levels.
RodentII can just as easily be turned into a strong GM as into a beginning
kid. It has both serious and funny personalities, like the positional
defender and the crazy attacker.


5. ZURICHESS
=========================
Author: Alexandru Moșoi
Version: graubuenden
Date: July 2016
Elo: 2450
Levels: yes
Chess960: no
License: BSD
Source: https://bitbucket.org/zurichess/
Description: Zurichess is a relatively young engine. Unlike most other engines it is
not written in C++ but in the Go computer language. And unlike other
engines, its versions are not numbered but named after the cantons of
Switzerland. New versions of Zurichess are rapidly following up each
other. The current version plays at gm level. Weaker opponents may
like to set its skill level a little lower.


6. FLOYD
=========================
Author: Marcel van Kervinck
Version: 0.9
Date: July 2016
Elo: 2300
Levels: no
Chess960: no
License: BSD
Source: https://github.com/kervinck/floyd/
Description: Originally written as a study in chess engine writing, Floyd has quickly
become one of the best master (FM/IM) strength engines. It was not
written for speed or strength, but rather for ‘clarity and ease of change’.
Nevertheless, the engine has an attractive style of play. Unfortunately
for weaker human players, Floyd cannot be forced to play weaker.


7. CINNAMON   
=========================
Author: Giuseppe Cannella
Version: 2.0
Date: May 2016
Elo: 2100
Levels: no
Chess960: no
License: GPLv3
Source: https://github.com/gekomad/Cinnamon/
Description: Cinnamon is the successor to Butterfly. It is an attractive opponent for
experienced club players. This engine does not play too strong but is not
very easy to beat either. If you have no FM or IM title and are looking for
a beatable engine that can teach you a thing or two about chess, then
Cinnamon is a good choice.


8. CLAUDIA
=========================
Author: Antonio Garro
Version: 0.5
Date: August 2016
Elo: 1650
Levels: no
Chess960: no
License: BSD
Source: https://github.com/antoniogarro/Claudia
Description: Claudia, named after the ‘father of information theory’ Claude E. Shannon,
is one of the weaker engines around. When playing on the modest
hardware of the Raspberry Pi it is an attractive opponent for intermediate
club players. Claudia has a remarkably human playing style.
