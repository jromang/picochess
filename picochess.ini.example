### Example and description how to configure PicoChess
### To use this file, simply copy this file to picochess.ini and edit the appropriate settings

### From v0.71 on some picochess.ini values are overridden when you change their values using the menu system
### Perhaps its a good idea to keep a copy of "picochess.ini" before you are going live with your picochess ;-)

### Lines that start with 3x# are general comments
### Lines that start with 2x# explain the option of the next line that starts with one # 
### Lines that start with 1x# are option lines, delete the # to use the option

## beep-level changes the occurrence of beeps. Minimum value is 0 (no beeps), maximum is 15 (all beeps).
## inside the clock menu you can choose between "always", "never" and "some". The value you give inside here, is

# beep-level = 3
## Should a confirmation message (after moves) be displayed? If not, please active the next line
# disable-ok-message = True
## Specify the serial port your dgt-board is connected to.
